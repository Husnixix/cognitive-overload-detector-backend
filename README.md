# Cognitive Overload Detector – Backend

This is the backend system for a **Cognitive Overload Detection** project, currently under **research and development (R&D)**.

The system is designed to estimate cognitive overload in real-time by combining:

- **Facial Cues**: blinking, yawning, gaze direction, and facial expressions  
- **Keyboard Interaction Patterns**: typing speed, error frequency, backspace usage, and pause durations

The backend is built with a **modular and layered architecture**, responsible for:

- Capturing and processing webcam and keystroke data  
- Extracting cognitive indicators from multiple input streams  
- Applying rule-based or lightweight ML scoring mechanisms  
- Serving data through API endpoints to a separate frontend system

> ⚠️ **Status**: This system is a work-in-progress and intended for research purposes only.
